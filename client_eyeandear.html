  Software that allows audiologists to gather information from audiology tests in a user-friendly manner.</p>
<p><span class="case_heading">Requirements :</span>
  <br />
  To create a flash based audiogram input tool as a component to a larger electronic systems upgrade for the Royal Australian Eye and Ear Hospital.</p>
<p>Prior to the creation of this component, audiologists were using paper-based records.  While the data management side of the application had already been created a frontend tool was required to replace this manual input method.  I was required to build a client side tool which would generically interface with this existing system via json.  The too  had allow for data to be generated and exported to the larger system, along with a screen capture of what had been created.</p>
<p>One of the primary features of the component is that it is easy to use. Doctors were already very familiar with the paper-based mechanism and the tool had to reflect this. Doctors would run the test on the patient and enter the points onto the system. Once all data is generated and saved, an image of the test data is exported and saved against the patient's record.</p>
