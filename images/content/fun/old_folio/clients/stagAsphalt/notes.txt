All movies must have the same background and frame rate

setupall the movies like mclv6.swf

on the first frame of the actions you must make the name of the movieClip + loaded equal to true eg.
sun.swf
would be sunLoaded.swf
This is done so the preloader does not load something that has already been loaded.

if i am going to use it I must change Andy's buttons
