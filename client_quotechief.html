<p><span class="case_heading">Brief Summary :</span><br />
A software application for Dulux accredited painters to allow them to provide fast, accurate and cost effective quotes for their clients.</p>


<p><span class="case_heading">Requirements :</span>
  <br />
Friday Media, in collaboration with Hannan IT, built an application for Dulux that would allow Dulux accredited painters to quickly create professional branded quotes for their customers. Dulux needed a system that would allow painters to synchronise product prices and information with a centralised repository. The system not only had to pull the latest product information but also allow painters to override price information with their own preferences. The system had to provide painters with the ability to login synchronise their products, move to an offline onsite location and create new quotes. Not only did the system have to operate in both an online and offline context but it also had to be available on both MACs and PCs. 
<p>After an extensive requirements analysis phase, Friday opted to build the solution using the Adobe AIR runtime. </p>
<p>In creating a quote, the painter would first enter the customer details. The painter would then create a new quote. This new quote was composed of rooms, surfaces within those rooms, and preparation, finish and other products used on those surfaces. The system would also allow them to specify labour rates and automatically calculate times required to paint certain rooms based on area to be painted and standard spread rates. The final output of the system was a quote identifying total material cost, labour and other costs. The quote consisted of a cover letter, quote terms, room level and surface breakdown detail and final sign off. The application then allowed resources to be attached to the quote.  A zip file was then generated by the application and emailed to the customer.(provided they were online). </p>

  <li>Project Management</li>
  <li>Coding and development â€“ including pdf generation and the development of cost calculation formulae that would efficiently identify the best priced combination of paint cans required to fulfil a job. E.g. If 12 litres of paint were required it may be more cost effective to get 3x4litre cans instead of 1x10litre can and a 2 litre can.</li>
